    <h1>VidYen VY256 Miner</h1>
    <p>This is a simple browser miner that uses VidYen’s VY256 pool. The UI, better hash tracking, and performance will be updated as development progresses.</p>
    <p>This pool runs through vy256.com server and is in development mode, which means the server may crash or be down at any time. Please contact us through support if you have problems.</p>
    <p>This allows you to use a local miner on WordPress that bypasses adblock or other AV software. That said, you should always explain what this is, and I’ve required the consent buttons by default.</p>
    <p>There is now a CPU control. It is not as precise as Coinhive, but it allows you to know use 100% by cranking it up to 6 (it’s possible to lock up your computer with two browsers open at 10, so I’m leaving a cap on it), or you can turn it to 0 to pause</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Hash updates sometimes come in waves as it has to go from your client’s browser to our stratum to the pool and then back each time.</p>
    <p>The benefit, however, is that this version does not require any account like Coinhive. AND as far as my testing goes, this version does not get blocked by uBLock or Brave. Also, Malwarebytes never complained in premium mode (unlike Coinhive). That alone makes the low CPU worth it, but we are working on getting the code better.</p>
    <p>All you need is an up to date Monero XMR wallet <a href="https://mymonero.com" target="_blank">MyMonero</a> and access to the <a href="https://moneroocean.stream/" target="_blank">MoneroOcean</a> pool, which only requires the XMR wallet to use.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> You must use a wallet that is compatible with the latest fork of Monero. If you have a wallet older than October, 2018 you should create a new one for this purpose. There is a new fork planned on March 9th, but if you wallet is new then it should be ok as long as it is with a company who choses to follow fork.</p>
    <p>The payouts and monitoring are through MoneroOcean (not VidYen). As the project progresses, we plan to add other pools, but currently, every seems fine with MoneroOcean.</p>
    <p>Even though this version did not cause uBlock, Brave Browser, or Malwarebytes to complain, VidYen, LLC is against the removal or obfuscation of the user consent system.</p>
    <p>You should make users aware that this miner may drain their battery and use their electrcity in your consent disclaimer.</p>
    <h1>Shortcodes and Syntax</h1>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> To display the simple miner you need to place the consent button shortcode on your page to create a POST call that the simple miner shortcode will recognize.</p>
    <p>Users must be logged in to see any of these shortcode as the intent was to track user effort.</p>
    <h2>Consent Button Shortcode</h2>
    <p>Replace (optional) and (required) with your info.</p>
    <p><b>[vyps-256-consent text=(optional) disclaimer=(optional)]</b></p>
    <p>Display the simple miner consent button. You can customize the text on the button by using text= and the disclaimer= by using. To add spaces in the button text, use quotes.</p>
    <h2>VY256 Miner Display Shortcode</h2>
    <p><b>[vyps-256 wallet=(required) pid=(required) throttle=(optional) site=(required)]</b></p>
    <p>This will display the simple miner after the button on the consent shortcode has been pressed.</p>
    <p>wallet: Your XMR wallet.</p>
    <p>pid: The VYPS point ID found in the “VYPS Point List” of the point type you want to redeem to.</p>
    <p>hash: Hashes by default redeemed for a 10000 hashes for 1 of your points. You can use the shortcode attribute hash= to set the has to any number above or below 10000. This was originaly set to 1024, but the 10000 hash worked out better with new speeds and GUI.</p>
    <p>threads: Default is 1 to only mine one thread. We would recommend leaving it set to 1 in the event your users have slow devices. Users can change this with the + or - buttons.</p>
    <p>throttle: The default is 50, which reduces CPU use by 50%, so they only use 50% for mining. I would also recommend leaving this set to 50 and allowing the user to increase it if they want to mine faster via the slider on the menu.</p>
    <p>timebar: The colored part of the top status bar. The default is timebar=yellow. As its CSS, it can be set to anything as such.</p>
    <p>workerbar: The colored part of the bottom status bar. The default is workerbar=orange. As its CSS, it can be set to anything as such.</p>
    <p>timebartext: The colored part of the top text status bar. The default is timebartext=white. As its CSS, it can be set to anything as such.</p>
    <p>workerbartext: The colored part of the bottom text status bar. The default is workerbartext=white. As its CSS, it can be set to anything as such.</p>
    <p>Example: <b>[vyps-256 wallet=48Vi6kadiTtTyemhzigSDrZDKcH6trUTA7zXzwamziSmAKWYyBpacMjWbwaVe4vUMveKAzAiA4j8xgUi29TpKXpm3wL5K5a pid=4 throttle=10 site=vidyen hash=1024 timebar=yellow workerbar=orange][vyps-256-consent]</b></p>
    <p>This will show the miner after the consent button has been clicked.</p>
    <h2>Graphics</h2>
    <p>You can use the shortcode graphic=0 to turn off animated worker or graphic=1 or 2 if you want to select a particular one. Plans for holidays coming soon!</p>
    <p>Also you can use your own graphics with cstatic=https://yourwordpresssite.com/your_still_image.gif and cworker=https://yourworedpresssite.com/your_animated_image.gif</p>
    <p>This will have a stopped miner who then animates after your user hits the start button.</p>
    <h2>Referral Mining</h2>
    <p>You can set shortcode option to <b>refer=10</b> to give 10% mining bonus to their referral code invite. This shortcode accepts whole numbers only and rounds down. In theory, a site admin could set refer=200 to give a 200% mining bonus, but I am not sure why you would as that could be abused.</p>
    <p>Users can set their referral code with the shortcode <b>[vyps-refer]</b>, which should give them a page to give and get their referral code. This is not an automatic system, and your users will have to manually add the code. There are plenty of login customization and user account plugins an admin can use to integrate this system with.</p>
    <h2>Miner Sharing</h2>
    <p>Mining sharing is a feature used to allow the XMR address by users to be shared for randomly allowing users to mine for other users based on the total owned points shared. This actually lets miners and even adwatchers to participate in getting faucets to pools by being shareholders in your point system.</p>
    <p><b>[vyps-xmr-wallet]</b></p>
    <p>To enable mining sharing, add the shortcode shareholder=1. Replace the 1 with the pointid that you want users to be ranked in. The way it works is that there is a weighted change for holder of most points of that type to get their wallet mined to say if one user owned 60% of that point type, they would have 60% type to win the display. If no one wins, it defaults to the site’s wallet. Admins can always be point owners as well, so look at leaderboards for fairness. I will make a leaderboard with percentage of ownership in next update.</p>
    <h1>Payout</h1>
    <p>The VY256 works in conjunction with the <a href="https://moneroocean.stream/" target="_blank">MoneroOcean</a> pool as a third-party service to handle wallet payouts.</p>
    <p>The rates of XMR per hash is determined by them as well as the minimum payouts. An account is not required, but by default, the minimum payout is 0.3 XMR, and if you wish to adjust that, you will have to create an account through them.</p>
    <p>To see your progress toward payout, visit the <a href="https://moneroocean.stream/#/dashboard" target="_blank">dashboard</a> and add your XMR wallet where it says Enter Payment Address at the bottom of page. There, you can see total hashes, current hash rate, and account option if you wish to change payout rate.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The hashes the user mines versus what MoneroOcean shows will differ because of fees and rejected hashes. As browser mining is often low CPU, many hashes are rejected, but VY256 rewards user regardless for fair effort. VY256 has a range of 1%–5% developer fee, depending on the overall network rate.</p>
    <h1>Localization</h1>
    <p>The following will allow you change the text to a localized version in your language:</p>
    <p>Redeem: <b>redeembtn="Redimir"</b></p>
    <p>Start: <b>startbtn="Comienzo"</b></p>
    <p>Example: <b>[vyps-256 wallet=48Vi6kadiTtTyemhzigSDrZDKcH6trUTA7zXzwamziSmAKWYyBpacMjWbwaVe4vUMveKAzAiA4j8xgUi29TpKXpm3wL5K5a pid=4 site=vidyen redeembtn="Redimir" startbtn="Comienzo"] Por favor consienta a la minería. [vyps-256-consent text="Yo Consiento"]</b></p>
    <h1>Custom Server</h1>
    <p>If you want to run your own <a href="https://github.com/VidYen/webminerpool" target="_blank">webminerpool</a> you can, but it needs to support MoneroOcean.</p>
    <p>You can use MoneroOcean webminepool directly if you want, but your end users may get an AV or adblocker hit on it.</p>
    <p>Websocket Server URL: <b>server=yourserver.com</b></p>
    <p>Websocket Port: <b>wsport=8181</b></p>
    <p>Nginx Port: <b>nxport=8081</b> (only needed if you do not want to use port 80 for hash tracking)</p>
    <p>As this is rather complex, unless you want to learn Debian (or other Linux server) and host the server yourself, we recommend just using the VY256 default server.</p>
    <h1>Support</h1>
    <p>Since this is running on our servers and we expanded the code, VidYen, LLC is the one handling the support. Please go to <a href="https://www.vidyen.com/about/" target="_blank">VidYen About</a> or on our <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/vidyen-point-system-vyps" target="_blank">WordPress support page</a>.</p>
    <p>If server is down and/or you need assistance immediately, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/6svN5sS" target="_blank">VidYen Discord</a> (It will ping my phone, so do not abuse. -Felty)</p>
    <p>For anyone who is trying this, we want to thank you for testing and that please let us know if you have any problems!</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that we and the pools take some fees, but it is generally way less than the Coinhives 20% fee, and you can get a smaller minimum payout of 0.003 XMR on MoneroOcean.</p>
    <p>Our code is open source, so if you want to run your own version, just go to our <a href="https://github.com/VidYen/VYPS-Plugin" target="_blank">github</a> and grab the code.</p>
    <h2>Supported pool list:</h2>
    <p>moneroocean.stream</p>
    <h2>Notes about hash rates:</h2>
    <p><b>It may take 60-120 seconds before MoneroOceans reports accepted hashes!</b></p>
    <p>Yes we could lie to you or your users, but generally it is bad form. This is an open system and involves several servers to avoid Adblockers and AV.</p>
    <p>You may have to let your users know that because we use a true pool (unlike Coinhive) that the hash rates need time to spool up before Monero Ocean gets at fool power.</p>
    <p>Since the VY256 miner now uses Hashes Accepted and not hashes worked, users need to wait 60 to 120 seconds before being acknoledged as accepted.</p>
    <p>And generally, if they let it run past 10 minutes it will go to maximum efficency. (I recently got up to 93 H/s on an i7 after 20 minutes at 6 threads and 80% cpu use on slider).</p>
    <p>In theory, I could allow the use of more than 6 threads, but in testing it was easy to lock up my computer testing in multiple tabs so for now, I believe its a safe comprimise.</p>
    <p>Because of the nature of the XMR network, hash rates do vary based on what random algo a block has decided to use. Other services such as Coinhive obfuscate this, but the idea is long term, not short term.</p>
    <p>You may want to create an instructions page and test this yourself.</p>

    <h2>Future plans.</h2>
    <p>We do have a goal to add more pools down the road, but for now, MoneroOcean works, and the developer of that pool is very responsive and fair.</p>
    <p>Felty has a goal to add MSR support because of its unique method of mining, but that will be down the road when it gets mining branches.</p>' .
