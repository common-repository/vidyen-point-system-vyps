//WW Balance update. NOW WITH ICON.

/* LIST FUCNTION SHORTCODE
*  Because an admin might just want a full list without messing around with
*  variables etc. Why not just make a single shortcode with differing variables?
*  Because this is how I would like it if I was admin with no coding experience.
*  I could in theory make a pid or uid for this, but honesty just recontruct the
*  shortcode [vyps-balance] to do that. It's easier for an admin to do that with
*  WP than me to mess around on the code end. Do not mistake my generosity for
*  generosity.
